# Engine 1401A1

This is a HTML5/Javascript game framework + build environment for demonstrating development concepts and for developing educational applications.
It is the successor to [Project 1401](https://github.com/daveseah/project-1401).

## Running the Project

You must have **Git** and **NodeJS** installed before executing the following commands from the terminal. 

Once you have these tools installed, you can clone the repo and cd to the `build` directory.

```
# clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/daveseah/Engine-1401A1.git
cd Engine-1401A1/build

# install dependencies
npm install

# run the appserver
gulp
```

The `gulp` command executes a default set of tasks: `gulp build` followed by `gulp server`. To see the application, navigate to the url displayed in the server console.
