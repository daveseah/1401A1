The `assets` directory contains media assets that will be loaded by a web page: images, scripts, and stylesheets.

The contents of the `assets/` directory is copied to the `public/` directory, where it is combined with `vendor` libraries to create the entire application. The contents are served by an ExpressJS web server instance launched by `gulp`.
