The goal is to make a game that incorporates graphics, sound, and physics. It doesn\'t really matter that is is a GREAT game; I\'m hopeful that this project will be helpful to others learning how to build a web app/game in Javascript for modern browsers. Along the way I hope I have some fun and put this old dream to rest.';
